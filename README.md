# Dylan Sarber's Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles. They are highly tuned to my own workflow. Feel free to
use, steal, or modify these files for your own purposes.

While my setup isn't "general" for anyone wanting to straight-up copy these
files, I've attempted to litter understandable comments everywhere for anyone
interested in learning from them.

**Warning:** Uninstalling modules is completely broken at the moment. Paths are
incorrect/missing when running uninstall functions.
